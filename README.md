# End-to-End Data Engineering Project: Adventure Works Using Azure Ecosystem

### Overview
This project presents a comprehensive end-to-end data engineering solution leveraging the Azure cloud ecosystem, demonstrating best practices through the integration of Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, Azure Databricks, Azure Synapse Analytics, Apache Spark, and Power BI. The aim is to build an efficient, scalable, and maintainable data pipeline using Adventure Works dataset as an illustrative example.

### Project Architecture

#### Data Source
- **Source Type:** HTTP-based REST API
- **Source Location:** GitHub repository
- **Description:** The project begins by establishing a direct HTTP connection to a GitHub API, pulling structured data into Azure.

#### Data Ingestion
- **Tool:** Azure Data Factory (ADF)
- **Features:**
  - Dynamic pipeline creation utilizing parameters and loop constructs
  - Enhanced scalability, maintainability, and error handling mechanisms
- **Process:** Automated extraction of data from the GitHub API, ensuring efficient, consistent, and accurate data ingestion.

#### Bronze Layer (Raw Data)
- **Tool:** Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
- **Architecture:** Medallion (Bronze-Silver-Gold)
- **Characteristics:**
  - Stores raw, untransformed data exactly as received from the source
  - Preserves data integrity, facilitating audit and lineage tracking
  - Serves as the foundational layer for subsequent data transformation

#### Silver Layer (Transformed Data)
- **Tool:** Azure Databricks and Apache Spark
- **Process:**
  - Performs data cleansing, validation, and transformation
  - Structured transformations and enrichment processes applied to convert raw data into a reliable, high-quality state
  - Implements Spark-driven analytics for scalable data processing

#### Gold Layer (Curated Data)
- **Tool:** Azure Synapse Analytics (Data Warehouse)
- **Description:**
  - Curates processed data optimized for business intelligence and analytics
  - Enables fast query performance, structured reporting, and advanced analytics
  - Provides the basis for deriving actionable insights

#### Data Visualization
- **Tool:** Power BI
- **Features:**
  - Interactive dashboards and insightful visualizations
  - Real-time analytics and reporting
  - Enables data-driven decision making through intuitive user interfaces

### Project Benefits
- End-to-end automated pipeline ensures data reliability and consistency
- Scalable architecture designed for easy expansion and flexibility
- Enhanced analytics capabilities through integrated Azure services
- Empowers stakeholders with actionable insights and robust data governance practices
